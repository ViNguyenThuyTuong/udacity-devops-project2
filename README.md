## Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

### Scenario
Our company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram.

We want to deploy a new application to the AWS infrastructure.

We have been tasked with provisioning the required infrastructure and deploying a dummy application, along with the necessary supporting software.

This needs to be automated so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.

### Solution.

I  designed an Architecture for Udagram using Lucid Chart. This architecture will be implementented in two categories i.e Network Infrastructure then Server Instances
